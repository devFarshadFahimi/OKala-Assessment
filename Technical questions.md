# Technical questions
----
These are just answers to Technical Questions section:
## Question-1 
Almost 12 hours, from 12:00 to 23:30,
I have never done TDD in a project in this way and I have always only read about it and this task created some challenges for me, but I am happy about it and if I had more free time, I could try to research more about TDD and write better test cases.

## Question-2
In latest version on .NET 9, the most important achivement was memory allocation and performance optimization for Minimal APIs which is up to 15% better than .NET 8 in handling requests per second, and also 93% better than .NET 8 in memory allocation.
There is another performance benchmark that explain how .NET is better than other programming languages on handling 1M tasks.

## Question-3
On the first step of tracking, I check networks communication to ensure there is not a network issue, after than I check the request to determine how long it takes to get response and the duration is logical or not,
after that, I will go to debug it on the source code and finding bottleneck and after that I try to fix it and make some improvement.
I have faced with dirty codes and not efficient queries that some developers wirte it on source codes and I always try to improve quering data from database and optimze data fetching performance which always has positive impact on the application.

## Question-4
Recently, I developed an application with MicroService architecture and this application needs an Event-Bus and Saga Orchestration to handling tracnsactions between services, I developed it by using Routing Slips in MassTransit.

## Question-5
As I like cryptocurrency and getting involved with it, this assessment was a good fit for me and I enjoyed writing codes for it, also as a technical prespective it was a little bit tricky.

## Question-6
